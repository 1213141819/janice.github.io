               Hey! I'm <strong>Janice</strong>. I always have some wonderful associations in my daily life. I find these<i> "flash" moments</i> very magical. Even though I don't remember exactly what I thought, but the magical feeling is still in my mind. I wanted to build a website to collect these ideas!Like a diary!
